# Core Test

## Overview

**Core Test** is a project built on the Aptos blockchain, designed to provide a reliable and scalable foundation for decentralized applications (dApps). This repository contains core functionalities, smart contracts, and testing frameworks for developers working with Aptos.

## Features

-   **Aptos Smart Contracts**: Written in Move, ensuring security and performance.
    
-   **Testing Framework**: Includes unit tests and integration tests for contract validation.
    
-   **Modular Architecture**: Easy to extend and integrate with other Aptos-based projects.
    
-   **Developer Friendly**: Well-documented APIs and clear examples for quick setup.
    

## Requirements

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

-   Aptos CLI
    
-   Rust (for building and testing)
    
-   Move compiler
    
-   Node.js (optional, for frontend integration)
